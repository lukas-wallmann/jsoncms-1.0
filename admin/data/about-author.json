He thought they all are to Big, loaded with functions noone really needs but when it comes to editing they are only a wysiwyg editor with an save button.</p>\n\n<p>As he started his work back in 2000 by leaning Flash, JavaScript is the closest alternative. And yeah it&#39;s a lot faster. Using Jquery and some small php files for api.</p>\n\n<p>He decided to not use MySQL as on Heavy loads this is not scaleable enougth. By Working with <a href=\"?title=sitelistjson\">admin/data/__sitelist.json</a>&nbsp;you could easily see how a cms could work to. All you need is to run json decode in your php and you got all data you need.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Lukas is 26, got 1 child (Emma), and lives in the mountains of Austria.</p>\n"}]}
